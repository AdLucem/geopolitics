### Q: Future of the US-India relationship in a pandemic world?

* Richard Verma
	** 2-decade upward trajectory of the US-India relationship, prediction is both linear and upward
	** Historical perspective- US-India relationship was estranged in the Johnson-Nixon era, but Kennedy and Eisenhower were pro-relationship
	** Eisenhower: "The hinge of fate in Asia rests with India". 
	** Also US perspective: that we should strive for an equal nation for people of the world... or something 
	** Questioned: are recent moves by Trump (withdrawing from WHO, visa issues etc) really dovetailing with Kennedy's vision of people equality w.r.t US-India ties?

* Navtej Sarna
	** Pandemic made us forget that there was solid progress made during the Trump-Modi visit
	** Around '92- US changed perspective on India and grew warmer to the idea of a relationship
	** Prediction: after the end of the pandemic, no matter the results of the election, US will recognize the logic of relationship with India
		*** Specific areas of co-coperation may change, but relationship will stay solid

* Richard Fontaine
	** India is the only bright spot in Trump's foreign policy
	** Focus on the US-India relationship has been sustained across multiple administrations both in the US and India
	** China-India standoff is an opportunity for the two countries to come closer

### Q: US stature as world leader seems to be threatened. Would this be a factor in the future US-India relationship?

* Richard Fontaine
	** Every time people- mostly Americans who seem to hold this opinion- thought that US's world leader role is threatened, US has bounced back
	** tl;dr: no

* Richard Verma
	** Not worried about decline of the US
	** US people are war-weary, but still want to play a role 
	in international affairs
	** Perhaps the greatest threat to the liberal postwar order is the US and it's breaking of institutions. This was not predicted, and needs to be corrected.
	** Remember that US-India relationship is based on the following shared ideas:
		*** Social justice
		*** Democracy
		*** Strategic interests
	** Wants to see us do more things operationally with the US, apart from just military exercises: disaster response, work together on development of other nations, clean energy partnership

* Navtej Sarna
	** If the US withdraws from the global stage then parters will be even more important for the US (why?)
	** Talking about divergences and confluences between US-India:
		*** Trump puts an undue focus on issues like trade inequalities, etc in his foreign policy. US relationship with India has always been unequal, but that is 'budgeted for' in the relationship
		*** Trump's admin focuses on the issue of immigration, and this __will__ be an issue in the future, particularly with Americans unemployed due to the pandemic- so yeah, factor for it in the future of this relationship
	** India needs to ask- is US cognizant of Indian interests in its dealings with __other__ countries?

### How will the India-China clash affect the US-India relationship

* Navtej Sarna
	** Yes, India is very upset about china, and will probably stay so
	** But US co-operation should not be simply military, but also economic, social and other areas
		*** Suggestion: pharmaceutical, India is a major supplier of generic drugs

* Richard Fontaine
	** US foreign policy should not assume that US and India will form an alliance against China
	** Strong economic relations with China from both countries will prevent a repeat of cold-war style blocs
	** US is not actually going to economically decouple from China, and neither is India (but!!! look at the actions of tech companies decoupling??? look it up)

### Will the pandemic and recession promote an isolationist tendency among countries?

* Richard Verma
	** Countries need to start working together TODAY to develop a global pandemic response that we do not have as of yet
	** Future also holds transnational challenges- eg: global warming- and US-India relationship is a good starting point to talk about these (but? given that the US is doing a reversal on international cooperation re: global warming- pulling out of the Kyoto agreement)

### Audience Comment: Salil Gupta, Boeing

Comment: Companies have a lot tied up in investments in India- particularly aviation (both military and domestic). We cannot let temporary relationship fluctuations affect the ups and downs of long-term investment strategy.

Reply by Richard Verma:
* Companies are ahead of the governments in this respect.
* Because of the market relationship between these two countries, US-India co-operation is important.
* Hopefully the US government will facilitate this

### Audience Question: Pratt&Whitney Managing Director

Comment: Looking at Modi's emphasis on self-reliance, and the necessity of localizing jobs during the downturn. Restructurin existing US-India supply chains will not be so simple.

Question: Will US actually look to India for restructuring supply chains previously in China?

Richard Fontaine:
* Companies are always rethinking supply chains in China
	** Because of a shifted perception of political and policy risk
* Places like India, bangladesh etc. can pick up these supply chains (yes, underpaid overexploited labour for the win!)
* However, there will be limits to this kind of restructuring- full decoupling is economically undesirable and unrealistic

Navtej Sarna
* Perhaps a realization in the aftermath of this pandemic will be that we are way too dependent on China at the cost of our own production capacity
* Countries might focus on regaining economic sovereignity
* This means not localizing all production, but maybe seeing who you're economically tied to, and whether the countries you're economically tied to are friendly. In essence, sort of forming economic blocs- regionality in trade

### Audience Question: William Blair, Head of Lockheed-Martin

Comment: US relationship with India moved from trade on transport aircraft to more capable aircraft

Question: US, India, Japan and Australia have similar trade interests and a shared trade relationship. Where do we see this going?

Richard Verma:
* India is due to advance into a more advanced operational relationship

### Question to Mr. Sarna: How much does geography factor in the India-US relationship

Navtej Sarna:
* This is a very cleverly disguised question (lol)
* India has to have a stable friction-free territory
* We want a non-disruptive relationship with China
* The recent aggressive rise of China points to a time of great power rivalry
* So ??? (India? US?) has a very narrow space to maneuver between China and Russia 

### Audience Question: Nick Khanna, BAE System

Comment: India's core military objective is to acquire the capability to take on China on India's own terms

Question: How to balance India's need for military capability and its need for self-reliance?

Answer (who said this?):
* India's push for indigenous production is not new. We work on joint production on our trade deals in a way that will build up domestic Indian capacity
* We need to deal with this tension on a case-to-case basic, think of: capability that India needs, who can generate that capability, how can we go about this in a way that benefits both sides.
